Leo's numbers - a little number sorting game for first grade children.

You can find it at [http://demo.loway.ch/leo-nums/](http://demo.loway.ch/leo-nums/)


The aim of the game is to sort numbers from 1 to 20. When all are sorted, you get an "OK" message.
Number sortings are touch-enabled, so you can play this for a tablet or anything.

You can define multiple exercises through its brains file:

* Numeric exercises, where you have to sort all numbers between min and max, or a subset of them
* Text exercises, where you have to sort phrases.
